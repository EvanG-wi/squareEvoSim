#Square Evolution Sim

#This program draws squares to the screen, the squares travel around the screen, 
#the squares have "genes" that give them different properties,
#the squares occasionally have square 'children', who receive the parent genes, with small changes
#bigger squares eat little squares
#squares can "see" other squares, they run away from predators and run towards prey
#squares eventually die from age or not eating
#over time the squares "evolve" and develop more ideal properties

#currently, the squares eventually develop into two "species" (it takes a while)
#big, fast, short-sighted, slow-reproducing squares  ::  and small, slow, long-sighted, fast-reproducing squares

#controls: left right arrows change FPS cap, "sflpgdhn" changes display, click on a square to highlight it and display its stats
